<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="images//netflix-ui-clone.png" alt="image">

I have been using Netflix for about a year and few days back I though why not to build a Netflix Landing Page clone. And now at last I gave it a real shape. Check it out and suggest me any improvement. 

App Story:
* The UI is built for learning purpose and for boosting my web development skills specially in CSS.
* I enjoyed it's development smile:

Of course, no one perfect and I feel myself still in learning phase of software development. There might be any zig zag flow of data and any bugs in this app. Feel free to create issues if you find any bug or have some suggestion

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
